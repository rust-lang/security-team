The Rust Security Response WG was notified that Cargo did not perform SSH host
key verification when cloning indexes and dependencies via SSH. An attacker
could exploit this to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2022-46176.

## Overview

When an SSH client establishes communication with a server, to prevent MITM
attacks the client should check whether it already communicated with that
server in the past and what the server's public key was back then. If the key
changed since the last connection, the connection must be aborted as a MITM
attack is likely taking place.

It was discovered that Cargo never implemented such checks, and performed no
validation on the server's public key, leaving Cargo users vulnerable to MITM
attacks.

## Affected Versions

All Rust versions containing Cargo before 1.66.1 are vulnerable.

Note that even if you don't explicitly use SSH for alternate registry indexes
or crate dependencies, you might be affected by this vulnerability if you have
configured git to replace HTTPS connections to GitHub with SSH (through git's
[`url.<base>.insteadOf`][1] setting), as that'd cause you to clone the
crates.io index through SSH.

## Mitigations

We will be releasing Rust 1.66.1 today, 2023-01-10, changing Cargo to check the
SSH host key and abort the connection if the server's public key is not already
trusted. We recommend everyone to upgrade as soon as possible.

Patch files for Rust 1.66.0 are also available [here][2] for custom-built
toolchains.

For the time being Cargo will not ask the user whether to trust a server's
public key during the first connection. Instead, Cargo will show an error
message detailing how to add that public key to the list of trusted keys. Note
that this might break your automated builds if the hosts you clone dependencies
or indexes from are not already trusted.
